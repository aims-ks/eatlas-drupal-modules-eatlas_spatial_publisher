Bug fixes[] = Remove link to empty network from the menu (network containing a single child)
Bug fixes[] = Create a "getFeature" method in the template context, that returns the feature associated with a feature ID if the feature exists. If the feature is a branch containing a single node, it doesn't return the feature (the feature needs to be bypass). This is used in the template to determine if a branch (Network) needs to be displayed in the breadcrumbs.
